# fizzbuzz
Making a loop that looks at numbers 1-100 then logs 'fizz' if the number is divisible by 3 or logs 'buzz' if the number is divisible by 5 and logs 'fizzbuzz' if the number is divisible by both. Logs the number if it isn't divisible by either. But! I got stubborn and wanted to only have the two messages: 'fizz' and 'buzz'. I did not want a third message: 'fizzbuzz'. So! If the number is divisible by both it needs to log both messages 'fizz'+'buzz'. All this is visible in the console only
